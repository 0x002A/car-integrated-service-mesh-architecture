# CAR-Integrated Service Mesh Architecture

The `CAR-Integrated Service Mesh Architecture` aims to enable a flexible (re-)deployment of software services within a
cluster of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) while maintaining a stable and reliable communication. It is a Service Mesh
Architecture adapted for an application to Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs). The architectural concepts are described in
more detail in the [original publication](https://doi.org/10.1145/3629104.3669938).

This repository contains our prototypical implementation as well as additional tooling and data.
